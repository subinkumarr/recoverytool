                Data recovery can be defined as a process of obtaining the information located on a storage device that cannot be accessed by the standard means due to its previous deletion or certain damage to the digital medium. Different approaches are used to regain the missing files, yet, only on the condition that their content is present somewhere within the storage. For instance, data recovery doesn't cover the situations when a file has never been written to a persistent storage, like documents that were created but could not be eventually saved to the hard disk drive due to a power failure. Also, none of the existing restore methods can cope with the cases of permanent erasure which occurs when some other information occupies its storage space – under such circumstances, the lost files can only be retrieved from an external backup.<br>

                <br> In general, data recovery techniques are divided into two types: software-based and ones involving the repair or replacement of the damaged hardware components in a laboratory setting. A software-based approach is employed in the majority of cases and involves the use of specialized utilities able to interpret the logical structure of the problem storage, read out the required data and deliver it to the user in a usable form for further copying. Physical repairs are conducted by specialists in the most severe instances, for example, when some mechanical or electrical parts of the drive no longer work properly – in this case, all the measures are directed towards a one-time extraction of the critical content, without the possibility of continued usage of the affected device. </br>

                Causes of Data Loss
            </h2>
            
            <p class="five"> <font size="4">
                Most data loss is caused by human error, rather than malicious attacks, according to U.K. statistics released in 2016. In fact, human error accounted for almost two-thirds of the incidents reported to the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office. The most common type of breach occurred when someone sent data to the wrong person.

<br> <br>Other common causes of data loss include power outages, natural disasters, equipment failures or malfunctions, accidental deletion of data, unintentionally formatting a hard drive, damaged hard drive read/write heads, software crashes, logical errors, firmware corruption, continued use of a computer after signs of failure, physical damage to hard drives, laptop theft, and spilling coffee or water on a computer.

                How Data recovery works

            </h2>

            <p class="seven"> <font size="4">

                The data recovery process varies, depending on the circumstances of the data loss, the data recovery software used to create the backup and the backup target media. For example, many desktop and laptop backup software platforms allow users to restore lost files themselves, while restoration of a corrupted database from a tape backup is a more complicated process that requires IT intervention. Data recovery services can also be used to retrieve files that were not backed up and accidentally deleted from a computer's file system, but still remain on the hard disk in fragments. <br> <br>

                Data recovery is possible because a file and the information about that file are stored in different places. For example, the Windows operating system uses a file allocation table to track which files are on the hard drive and where they are stored. The allocation table is like a book's table of contents, while the actual files on the hard drive are like the pages in the book. <br> <br>

                When data needs to be recovered, it's usually only the file allocation table that's not working properly. The actual file to be recovered may still be on the hard drive in flawless condition. If the file still exists -- and it is not damaged or encrypted -- it can be recovered. If the file is damaged, missing or encrypted, there are other ways of recovering it. If the file is physically damaged, it can still be reconstructed. Many applications, such as Microsoft Office, put uniform headers at the beginning of files to designate that they belong to that application. Some utilities can be used to reconstruct the file headers manually, so at least some of the file can be recovered. <br> <br>

                Most data recovery processes combine technologies, so organizations aren't solely recovering data by tape. Recovering core applications and data from tape takes time, and you may need to access your data immediately after a disaster. There are also risks involved with transporting tapes. <br> <br>

                In addition, not all production data at a remote location may be needed to resume operations. Therefore, it's wise to identify what can be left behind and what data must be recovered  <br>
